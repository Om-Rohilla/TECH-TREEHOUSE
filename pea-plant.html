        <h3>STEP 1: Soaking</h3>
        <li> Soften the seed coat by soaking the pea seeds in water for 12 hours before planting. This encourages more rapid germination.</li>
        <h3>STEP 2: Choose the Right Soil</h3>
        <li>Peas prefer well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. If your soil is heavy clay or sandy, mix in organic matter like compost to improve its structure.</li>
        <h3>STEP 3: Sowing</h3>
        <li> Plant the soaked seeds 1 inch deep and 3 inches apart for vining varieties or 4-5 inches apart for bush varieties. You can also sow in rows, with seeds spaced 1-2 inches apart.</li>
        <h3>STEP 4: Temperature</h3>
        <li>: Wait until the soil reaches a temperature of around 10°C (50°F) before sowing. If spring is slow to arrive, warm the soil with polythene sheeting or a cloche before sowing.</li>
        <h3>STEP 5: Watering</h3>
        <li>Keep the soil consistently moist during the germination period (7-10 days). Once seedlings emerge, reduce watering to about 1 inch per week.</li>
        <h3>STEP 6: Support</h3>
        <li> Provide support for vining pea varieties by installing a trellis, fence, or other structure for them to climb.</li>
        <h3>STEP 7: Thinning</h3>
        <li>Once seedlings have 2-3 sets of leaves, thin them out to 6-8 inches apart to prevent overcrowding and promote healthy growth.</li>
        <h3>STEP 8: Maintenance</h3>
        <li>Keep the area weed-free and provide moderate maintenance, including occasional watering and fertilization.</li>
        <h3>STEP 9: Harvest</h3>
        <li>Peas are ready to harvest when the pods are plump and tender. Check for readiness by gently tugging on a pod; if it comes off the stem easily, it’s ready. Harvest regularly to encourage the plant to produce more pods.</li>

                                   <li>Peas are a cool-season crop and grow well in temperatures below 70°F (21°C). Growth and pod production decline above 85°F (29°C).</li>
                                   <li>Consider planting peas in late summer for a fall harvest, about 2 months before your average first frost date. This allows for a second crop before winter.</li>
                                   <li>Pea shoots can also be grown indoors or in shady outdoor spaces, using the same basic steps. Simply sow the seeds in a container and keep them moist and bright.</li>

            By following these steps, you should be able to successfully grow a litchi plant from seed. Good luck!
