              <h3>STEP 1: Obtain a Fresh Mango Seed</h3> 
              <li>Choose a ripe mango and extract the seed. Make sure the seed is fresh and not dried out.</li>
              <li>Remove the pulp and fibers from the seed, leaving only the hard, brown seed coat.</li>
              <h3>STEP 2: DRY THE SEED</h3>
              <li>Let the seed dry for 1-2 days to prevent mold and fungal growth.</li>
              <li>This step is crucial to ensure the seed germinates properly.</li>
              <h3>STEP 3: PREPARE THE SEED HUSK </h3>
              <li>Cut a small portion of the seed husk (about 1-2 cm) to create an opening. </li>
              <li>  Gently pry open the husk to reveal the white seed inside.</li>
              <li>  Remove any papery or fibrous material from the seed surface.</li>
              <h3>Step 4: Plant the Seed</h3>
              <li>Fill a small container (like a yogurt cup or a seed starting tray) with a well-draining seed starting mix.</li>
              <li>Plant the seed about 1/2 inch deep, with the pointed end facing upwards.</li>
              <li>  Water gently but thoroughly.</li>
              <h3>Step 5: Provide Optimal Conditions</h3>
              <li>Place the container in a warm, bright location with indirect sunlight (avoid direct sunlight, which can cause  overheating).</li>
                <li>a consistent temperature between 75°F to 85°F (24°C to 29°C).</li>
               <li> Water sparingly, as the seedling will require minimal moisture.</li>
               <h3>Step 6: Wait for Germination</h3>
                <li>It may take 1-3 weeks for the seed to germinate. Be patient, as germination rates can vary.</li>
               <li> Once the seedling emerges, remove any remaining seed husk and trim the roots to encourage healthy growth.</li>
               <h3>Step 7: Transplant</h3>
               <li>After 4-6 months, when the seedling has 2-3 sets of leaves and is about 6-8 inches tall, transplant it into a larger container (at least 12 inches deep) with a well-draining potting mix.</li>
               <li>Harden off the seedling by gradually exposing it to outdoor conditions over the course of 7-10 days before transplanting it into the ground.</li>
               <h3>Step 8: Plant in the Ground</h3>
               <li>Choose a location with full sun and well-draining soil. Mango trees prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil pH (5.5-7.0).</li>
               <li>Dig a hole 3-4 times larger than the root ball, and gently place the seedling in the hole.</li>
               <li>Backfill with soil, and water thoroughly.</li>
               <h3>Step 9: Ongoing Care</h3>
               <li>Water regularly, providing about 1 inch of water per week.</li>
               <li>Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season (spring-fall).</li>
               <li>Prune the tree regularly to maintain a strong, open structure and encourage fruiting.</li>

                <ul><i>     <b>
                                 <li>Mango trees grown from seed may not produce fruit true to the parent tree’s variety.</li>
                                 <li>Seed-grown mango trees can take 5-8 years or more to produce fruit, whereas grafted trees may produce fruit within 3-5 years.</li>
                                 <li>Mango trees are sensitive to frost, so protect them from frost damage if you live in an area with cold winters.</li>
                            </b>

                By following these steps, you should be able to successfully grow a mango tree from seed. Good luck!
